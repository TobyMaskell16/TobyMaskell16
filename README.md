Hello! I’m Toby. I am interested in learning and practicing ML techniques. I work in general insurance currently but have often sought data science coding experiences in other industries for instance: retail, banking, local governance, and marketing. 

I am particularly partial to clustering and ensembling however I have no clear dislikes!

That said, I prefer practical applications over theoretical pursuits...
